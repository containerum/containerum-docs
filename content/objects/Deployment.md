# How to work with a Deployment

## Description

Deployment is an object that contains the configuration of running applications. It has a large number of parameters, that can be set during deployment creation. One of the main parameters is a container. Containers describe images, resources, environment variables, etc. that are necessary for user applications to run properly. One or more applications can run in one deployment.
Users can describe apps in separate deployments and connect them using [internal services](/getting-started/object-types/#service)
or describe apps as different containers belonging to the same deployment.
In this case, applications are accessible to each other by the container name and port.
A user can bind [configmaps](/getting-started/object-types/#configmap) to deployments to use configuration files, certificates, etc.
Containerum deployments support revision control. When a user updates a deployment image, the new revision
will be saved in Containerum. User can get a revision list, rename a revision, rollback to any selected version, etc. Containerum uses semantic versioning for deployments.

## Requirements
