# How to work with a Project

## Description

Project is the main object of Containerum. To create a project a user needs to allocate RAM and CPU resources to the project. With Containerum a user can allocate as much of the available resources as necessary. All other system objects (deployments, services, etc.) can exist only within a Project. As part of teamwork, project owners can share their projects with other users and set access levels to build new software together.

A detailed description of the Project entity is available [here](/getting-started/object-types/#project).

## Requirements
To create a project you need to have enough available resources on your machine(s).

## Create

If you don't have any projects yet, click on the `Create project` button in the Dashboard.

 - Name - can include a-z, 0-9, -. Example: `test-project`.

 - CPU (in mCPU)- must be number. Example: `512`.
