# Containerum requirements

Before installing Containerum make sure you have the following components:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)  
Note: if you have installed Kubernetes using [Containerum Distribution of Kubernetes](https://cdk-docs.hub.containerum.io/installation/), there's no need to install Docker.
- [Kubernetes](https://cdk-docs.hub.containerum.io/installation/) 1.5 or higher  
Note: You can also use [Let's Kube](https://github.com/containerum/letskube) utility to install the latest versions of Docker and Kubernetes on your VMs.  
- Helm
- Installed Kubernetes [Ingress Controller](https://github.com/containerum/containerum/blob/master/ingress.md)



Note: To launch deployments in Containerum you need to have an application node. In case you use only one node, make sure it is labeled as `slave`.  To add the label, run:

```
kubectl label node ubuntu-01 role=slave
```
where `ubuntu-01` is the name of your node.
