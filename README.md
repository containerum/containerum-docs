Containerum docs is a documentation project for [Containerum Platform](https://github.com/containerum/containerum). It contains  guides on installing and configuring Containerum Platform, manuals, CI/CD instructions, etc.
Containerum Platform Docs can be launched locally with YARN and Hugo. We strive to make docs as clear and substantial as possible, so we welcome contributions and advice.


## Requirements
* [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) > v0.39

## Run locally
If you want to contribute to docs and watch changes locally before you make a commit, run:
```
  gulp build
  hugo serve --bind 0.0.0.0 -w

## Note
1. All *static* files should be put in **static_src** folder
